  Question 1: What new column has been added as a result of applying the join function to the "Narrow" dataset and CellTypes data sets in the above line of code?

	`TODO`

  Question 2: Plot 1 is created below. In terms of the x-axis and y-axes (tissue and gene expression, respectively), offer an interpretation of what the below plot is describing about tissue types.

	`TODO`

  Question 3: Plot 2 (created below) is a bar-chart view of the same information from Plot 1. How is this plot more informative than the previous Plot 1?

	`TODO`

  Question 4: What is the function "mutate()" doing in the above code block?

	`TODO`

  Question 5: Inside the above code block, we note that there is "na.rm=TRUE". What does this code do?

	`TODO`

  Question 6: In terms of the x-axis and y-axes (tissue and gene expression, respectively), interpret the results of Plot 3, created below.

	`TODO`

  Question 7: Interpret the results of Plot 4, created by the code block below.

	`TODO`

  Question 8: In Plot 5, both of the previous plots have been combined together on the same canvas. How does this, either help or confuse the output of these lines of code?

	`TODO`

  Question 9: What do the whiskers (i.e., the big "I" shaped structures above each histogram bar) convey in this plot? Why might we need to know this information?

	`TODO`

  Question 10: The word, "function" is below in the code block. What does the "lm()" part of the code block do?

	`TODO`

  Question 11:  With respect to the above discussion of R-squared variables, which Probe in Plot 8 appears to be able to best explain its model?

	`TODO`

  Question 12: In Plot 9 we see two curves. What can you infer about the relationships between the Actual cases of relationships (blue curve) and those cases for which no relationship exists (red curve)? Remember, the blue curve corresponds to the variable "r2" and the red curve corresponds to the Null values.

	`TODO`

  Question 13: Plot 10 created below, is very important to determine a result concerning the Actual (blue) data sets and the Null (red) data sets. In terms of the distribution of the red and blue points, explain what this plot, created using the below code block, describes about the two groups.

(This is the end of the questions over gene expression and two extra questions follow.

Question 14: Which command allows the user to create a new column in a dataset?
	A. `mutate()`
	B. `select()`
	C. `arrange()`
	D. `filter()`


	Answer: `TODO`


Question 15: Which command allows the user to isolate specific _rows_ of a dataset?
	A. `mutate()`
	B. `select()`
	C. `arrange()`
	D. `filter()`


	Answer: `TODO`
